    "2. Calculate the remainder when one number is divided by another using the modulus operator `%`.\n",
    "3. Perform floor division (`//`) on two numbers.\n",
    "4. Use the exponent operator `**` to calculate the power of a number.\n",
    "5. Compare two numbers using comparison operators (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`) and print the results.\n",
    "6. Use logical operators `and`, `or`, `not` on boolean variables and print the results.\n",
    "7. Use assignment operators (`+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`, `**=`) to update a variable and print its value after each operation.\n",
    "8. Use identity operators (`is`, `is not`) to compare two variables.\n",
    "9. Use membership operators (`in`, `not in`) to check if a character exists in a string.\n",
